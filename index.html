		<h2>ABOUT</h2>
		
		<p>As Pleebie Jeebies, we pride ourselves with our desire to learn and improve. We write efficient, clean code and provide detailed documentation along with dedicated support where possible.</p>
		<p>From the beginning, we had a plan to use our previous knowledge as developers to make assets for Unity and began by cutting our teeth making mobile games in Unity starting in September, 2019.</p>
		<p>We released our first game, Postal Pandemic, in June 2020 and released our second game, Crime Spree 3D, in April 2021.
		From here, we had accrued some tools from creating our games and decided to polish up these tools for other developers and focus on assets for Unity.</p>
		<p>Since then, we've released the IMMEDIATE In App Updater for Google Play, the Day, Night, and Light Controller (3D), and the Asset Cleaner on the Unity Asset Store as tools for other Unity developers.</p>
		<p>Read on for more details about the assets and games we've released!</p>

		<h2>UNITY ASSETS</h2>
		
		<p>This section will cover each of <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/52931">our released assets</a> to the Unity Asset Store.</p>
		
		</br>
		
		<h3>Rotating and Flashing Light</h3>
		<p>Provides a simple way to add an alarm, siren, or emergency lighting to a scene. Also allows you to change the color or control the light how you please, allowing the creator to invent their own uses.</p>
		<p>See the asset in more detail <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/rotating-and-flashing-light-231972">here</a>, or for documentation click <a href="https://pleebiejeebies.github.io/RotatingFlashingLightDocumentation.html">here</a></p>
		
		<h3>Asset Cleaner</h3>
		<p>With the press of a button, the Pleebie Jeebies Asset Cleaner will scan a project for unused assets and gives the option to delete them in a nice checkbox list format.</p>
		<p>See the asset in more detail <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/asset-cleaner-203496">here</a>, or for documentation click <a href="https://pleebiejeebies.github.io/AssetCleanerDocumentation.html">here</a></p>
		
		<h3>Day, Night, and Light Controller (3D)</h3>
		<p>With a prefab that you just drag and drop into any scene, you can easily have a Day and Night cycle. This same prefab can control lights to turn on at night and off in the morning. Or simply turn off this setting with a checkbox.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>See the asset in more detail <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/day-night-and-light-controller-3d-201611">here</a>, or for documentation click <a href="https://pleebiejeebies.github.io/DayNightControllerDocumentation.html">here</a></p>
		
		<h3>IMMEDIATE In App Updater for Google Play</h3>
		<p>With a prefab that you just drag and drop into any scene, you can automatically check if there is a newer version of your app published on the Google Play Store and notify your users to update it.</p>
		<p>See the asset in more detail <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/immediate-in-app-updater-for-google-play-191048">here</a>, or for documentation click <a href="https://pleebiejeebies.github.io/InAppUpdaterDocumentation.html">here</a></p>
