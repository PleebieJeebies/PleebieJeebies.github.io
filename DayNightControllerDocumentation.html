	<h2>About</h2>
	
	<p>The Day, Night, and Light Controller asset provides a simple way to add and control day 
	and night cycles in your 3D landscape scene. By default, this asset can also control lighting 
	in the scene to turn off during the day and back on at night. This setting can be turned off 
	by the use of a checkbox if you would like to control lighting through other means.</p>

	<p>The main functions of this asset are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Changes rendered lighting settings based on gradient presets to simulate a day and night cycle in the scene</li>
		<li>Easily change these presets to desired coloring</li>
		<li>Change the sun’s direction</li>
		<li>Control cycle speed to go by slower or faster</li>
		<li>Control lighting to go on and off based on time of day</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Asset Files Hierarchy</h2>

	<p>All files are located under <b>Assets/PleebieJeebies/</b></p>
	<div class="imageContainer">
		<img src="DayNight/DayNightFileHierarchy.png" alt="Asset File Hierarchy">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Prefabs Folder</h3>
	<p>The <i>Prefabs</i> folder contains the <b>DayNightAndLightController</b> prefab and three 
	spotlight prefabs used in the scene. The controller prefab can be dragged into any scene in 
	your project to start using it.</p>
	<p>The controller prefab also comes with its own directional light; you should only have one 
	in your scene otherwise you may get undesired results.</br>If you already have a directional 
	light in your scene with your desired settings, just copy over the light component properties 
	to the directional light contained in the controller prefab, along with any other components 
	on your directional light, and delete any other directional lights in the scene.</p>
	<p>The three spotlight prefabs are spotlights pre-built with settings that allow for casting 
	shadows at different angles.</p>

	<h3>Scenes Folder</h3>
	<p>The <i>Scenes</i> folder contains a demonstration (demo) scene that displays the day and night 
	cycle and lighting that turns on and off depending on the time of day. Coloring is 
	controlled by a preset. The <i>Scripts Folder</i> section will cover where to find these presets.</p>
	
	<h3>Scripts Folder</h3>
	<p>The <i>Scripts</i> folder contains two scripts and a folder: the <b>LightManager</b> script is the 
	functionality of this asset and the <b>LightPreset</b> script is a Unity scriptable object to 
	allow for easily creating color gradients used in the manager.</p>
	<p>The <b>LightPresets</b> folder contains two presets, which are also used in the scene: one 
	for the day and night cycle coloring, the other for spot light coloring. To change this 
	coloring, see the <a href="#coloring">Changing Coloring</a> section.</p>
	
	
	<div class="pushdown" id="config"></div>
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	
	<p>The configuration section covers the variables and modifiers used on the day, 
	night, and light controller prefab.</p>
	<p>You do not have to manually configure anything on the controller prefab as it functions 
	by simply dragging it into any scene.</p>
	
	<div class="imageContainer">
		<img src="DayNight/DayNightInspector.png" alt="Configuration">
	</div>
	
	<p><b>Directional Light</b> – Contains the directional light object you would like the controller 
	prefab to use in the scene. By default, it is set to the directional light provided in the prefab.</p>
	<p><b>Day Night Preset</b> – Contains a <b>LightPreset</b> scriptable object set to change the scene 
	coloring for the day and night cycle. You should explore this preset object and change the 
	coloring to match your desired output. Read the <a href="#coloring">Changing Coloring</a> section on how to do this.</p>
	<p><b>Lamp Preset</b> – Contains a <b>LightPreset</b> scriptable object for turning on the lights 
	during the night cycle.</p>
	<p><b>Time Of Day</b> – The current minute of the cycle the prefab is in. The range is between 0 
	and 1440 (24 x 60) equaling how many minutes are in a real day. 0 representing 0:00am or midnight 
	and 1440 representing 11:59pm or the minute before midnight.</p>
	<p><b>Sun Direction</b> – Control where the directional light or ‘sun’ rises and sets. The value 
	can be changed between 0 and 360 representing the full rotation of a circle, anything more than 
	360 continues the same rotation. The value you set is where the sun rises.</br>
	For example, if the value is 0, but you want the sun to rise on the opposite side of the scene 
	from where it is currently, set it to 180. 90 will be a quarter way around the scene from 0, and 
	270 is three quarters around the scene from 0.</p>
	<p><b>Time Multiplier</b> – Sets the speed at which the <b>Time Of Day</b> is calculated. Leaving it at 1 
	means one minute is one real life second. Higher than 1 means time will go by quicker and lower 
	than 1 means slower. For example, if the value is at 1, a full cycle takes 24 real minutes, or at 
	60, 24 real seconds, or at 1/60 ie. 0.016 repeating, 24 real hours.</p>
	<p><b>Control Lights</b> – Control <b>all non-directional lights</b> in the current scene to work 
	according to the day and night cycle simulated. Toggle this off to make the prefab not control 
	these lights. The <i>Control Lights</i> toggle does not stop the control of the directional light as that 
	is the main ‘sun’ for the scene to simulate the cycle.</p>

	<h2>Changing Coloring</h2>
	
	<p>To change the color simulating the day and night cycle, select the SunlightPreset file located 
	in <b>PleebieJeebies/Scripts/LightPresets/</b></p>
	<p>Use the color gradient boxes to change to a desired color palette.</p>
	
	<div class="imageContainer">

	</div>
	
	<p><b>Ambient Color</b> – Coloring of the render settings ambient lighting in the scene.</p>
	<p><b>Directional Color</b> – Set the amount of light or color given off by the directional light 
	or ‘sun’.</p>
	<p><b>Fog Color</b> – Coloring of the render settings fog coloring in the scene.</p>
