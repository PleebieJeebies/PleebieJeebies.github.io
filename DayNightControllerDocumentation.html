		</div>
	</div>

	<p>This asset provides a simple way to add a day and night cycle to your 3D landscape. 
	By default, it can also control lighting in the scene to turn off during the day and 
	back on at night. This setting can be turned off via checkbox if you would like to control 
	lighting via other means.</p>

	<p>The main functions of this asset are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Changes rendered lighting settings based on gradient presets to simulate a day and night cycle in the scene</li>
		<li>Easily change these presets to desired coloring</li>
		<li>Change the sun’s direction</li>
		<li>Control cycle speed to go by slower or faster</li>
		<li>Control lighting to go on and off based on time of day</li>
	</ul>

	<div class="pushdown" id="hierarchy"></div>
	<h2>Asset Files Hierarchy</h2>

	<p>This section will cover what each file folder contains in the asset.</p>
	<p>All files are located under <b>Assets/PleebieJeebies/</b></p>
	<div class="imageContainer">
		<img src="DayNightFileHierarchy.png" alt="Asset File Hierarchy">
	</div>
	
	<h3>Prefabs Folder</h3>
	<p>In this folder you will find the DayNightAndLightController prefab as well as three spot 
	light prefabs which all are used in the scene. The controller prefab can be dragged in to any 
	scene in your project to start using it. This prefab also comes with its own Directional 
	Light; you should only ever have one in your scene. If you already have a Directional Light 
	in your scene, just copy over the required properties to the one under the prefab and delete 
	the old <b>otherwise you may get errors</b>.</p>
	<p>The three spot light prefabs are just spot lights pre-built with settings that allow for 
	casting shadows at different angles.</p>

	<h3>Scenes Folder</h3>
	<p>This folder has a demo scene to display the day and night cycle along with lighting that turns 
	on and off depending on the time of day.</p>
	
	<h3>Scripts Folder</h3>
	<p>This folder contains two scripts and another folder: the LightManager script houses the 
	functionality of this asset and the LightPreset script is a unity scriptable object to allow 
	for easily creating color gradients used in the manager. The LightPresets folder contains two 
	presets which are also used in the scene: one for the day and night cycle coloring, the other 
	for spot light coloring.</p>
	
	
	<div class="pushdown" id="config"></div>
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	
	<p>You don’t have to configure anything on the prefab as it works by simply dragging it in 
	to any scene, but this section will cover the variables and modifiers used on the day, night, 
	and light controller prefab.</p>
	
	<div class="imageContainer">
		<img src="DayNightInspector.png" alt="Configuration">
	</div>
	
	<p>Directional Light – this variable is set to contain the Directional Light object you 
	would like to use in the scene. By default, it is set to the one in the prefab, but you can 
	set your own if you wish.</p>
	<p>Day Night Preset – this variable contains a LightPreset scriptable object set to change 
	the scene coloring for the day and night cycle. You should explore this preset and change 
	the coloring to match your desired output. Read the next section on how to do this.</p>
	<p>Lamp Preset – this variable contains a LightPreset scriptable object for setting the 
	lights on during the night time of the cycle.</p>
	<p>Time Of Day – this variable represents the current minute of the cycle the prefab is in 
	currently. The range is between 0 and 1440 (24 x 60) that being how many minutes are in a 
	real day. 0 being 0:00am or midnight and 1440 being 11:59pm or the minute before midnight.</p>
	<p>Sun Direction – changing this value will allow you to control where the ‘sun’ rises and 
	sets. This means the value can be changed between 0 and 360 as that is the full rotation of 
	a circle, anything more will just continue the same rotation.</p>
	<p>Time Multiplier – this value sets the speed at which the Time Of Day is calculated. 
	Leaving it at 1 means one minute is one real life second. Higher than 1 means time will go 
	by quicker and lower means slower. This means at 1, a full cycle will take 24 real minutes, 
	or at 60, 24 real seconds, or at 1/60 ie. 0.016 repeating, 24 real hours. You get the idea.</p>
	<p>Control Lights – this Boolean value is set to true by default and allows the control of 
	<b>all non-directional lights</b> in the current scene to work according to the day and night 
	cycle simulated. It can be un-checked to make the prefab not control these lights. This 
	will not stop the control of the directional light as that is the main ‘sun’ for the scene 
	to simulate the cycle.</p>
	
	
	<div class="pushdown" id="coloring"></div>
	<h2>Changing Coloring</h2>
	
	<p>To change the color that is simulating the day and night cycle, you can look to the 
	SunlightPreset file housed in PleebieJeebies/Scripts/LightPresets/.</p>
	<p>Simply click on the color gradient boxes to change coloring used for the cycle.</p>
	
	<div class="imageContainer">
		<img src="SunlightPreset.png" alt="Sunlight Preset">
	</div>
	
	<p>Ambient Colour – this is used for coloring of the render settings ambient lighting in 
	the scene.</p>
	<p>Directional Colour – this is used to set the amount of light or color given off by the 
	directional light or ‘sun’.</p>
	<p>Fog Colour – this is used for coloring of the render settings fog coloring in the scene.</p>
